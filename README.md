# particle-collision-classification
This project applies machine learning techniques to a high-energy physics dataset, where the goal is to accurately distinguish rare signal (s) events from abundant background (b) events. Each event contains reconstructed kinematic features and an associated event weight reflecting its experimental relevance.
